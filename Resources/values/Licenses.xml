<br/>
LzxDecoder.cs was derived from libmspack<br/>
Copyright 2003-2004 Stuart Caie<br/>
Copyright 2011 Ali Scissons<br/>
<br/>
The LZX method was created by Jonathan Forbes and Tomi Poutanen, adapted
by Microsoft Corporation.<br/>
<br/>
This source file is Dual licensed; meaning the end-user of this source file
may redistribute/modify it under the LGPL 2.1 or MS-PL licenses.<br/>
<br/>
About<br/>
-----<br/>
This derived work is recognized by Stuart Caie and is authorized to adapt
any changes made to lzxd.c in his libmspack library and will still retain
this dual licensing scheme. Big thanks to Stuart Caie!<br/>
<br/>
This file is a pure C# port of the lzxd.c file from libmspack, with minor
changes towards the decompression of XNB files. The original decompression
software of LZX encoded data was written by Suart Caie in his
libmspack/cabextract projects, which can be located at<br/>
